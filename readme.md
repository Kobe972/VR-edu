## Expected Functionality
* The professor can teach its students using screen share, especially powerpoint in the scenario.
* People can draw lines in the space to facilitate their comprehension and analysis.
* People can import 3D objects and determine whether the object can be seen or operated by others. Particularly, the professor can bring the model it wants to use into the class.
* Some types of classrooms are specified. For example, an operating room, where a corp is placed in the center of the classroom and the professor or its students can operate it.
